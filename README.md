# User Story

Our plan is make a faux website for a music festival, with full CRUD functionality in the form of being able to "buy" tickets to said festival, view the lineup, set times, and even post alongside others about your excitement to see this or that artist!

The festival page a many-to-many relation between stages and DJ's.
