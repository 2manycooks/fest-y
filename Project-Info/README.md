# User Story

Our plan is make a faux website for a music festival, with full CRUD functionality in the form of being able to "buy" tickets to said festival, view the lineup, set times, and even post alongside others about your excitement to see this or that artist!

The festival page a many-to-many relation between stages and DJ's.

## Our plan for MVP:

You open on a landing page. this features a splash of an image of people having fun at EDC. you've got a nav bar, which takes you to the index of stages, or artists, based on which one you pick. Selecting a stage from the index will reveal the setlist of artists, whom you can then click to view particular info about them. Vice versa, selecting 'artists' will show info about that artist, including name, genre, top hits, and links to the stages where they will be playing, providing a full connection between all pages on the site.

On top of being able to view information, we plan to add a section to comment your excitement about both artists AND stages. Our original idea is NOT to have a separate page with a form to add comments, as we feel far more websites allow a form for adding a comment right into the show page. 

As for icebox goals, our biggest ones are links to songs, perhaps a whole other 'merchandise' model to peruse, images of artists, additional accessibility features, as well as of course as much cool, fun, trppy styling as possible.
